1. 8-Puzzle Problem:
Algorithm:
Define the start state and goal state of the 8-puzzle.
Use a BFS (Breadth-First Search) or A* algorithm for state exploration.
For BFS, enqueue the initial state and explore neighbors.
For A*, use a priority queue based on the heuristic (e.g., Manhattan distance).
Continue until the goal state is reached.
Backtrack to find the solution path.

2. 8-Queen Problem:
Algorithm:
Start with an empty chessboard.
Place a queen in the first row.
For each subsequent row, place a queen such that no two queens threaten each other.
Use recursion to backtrack if no valid placement is possible.
If queens are placed in all rows, the solution is found.

3. Water Jug Problem:
Algorithm:
Define two jugs with capacities A and B.
Use a BFS or DFS algorithm to explore all possible states (combinations of water in the jugs).
Each state transition is pouring water between jugs or emptying/filling them.
The goal state is reached when one jug contains the required amount of water.

4. Crypt-Arithmetic Problem:
Algorithm:
Treat each letter in the crypt-arithmetic problem as a variable.
Assign digits (0-9) to each letter while ensuring that different letters have different digits.
Solve the arithmetic equation by exploring all possible digit assignments (backtracking).
If a valid solution satisfies the equation, print the result.

5. Missionaries and Cannibals Problem:
Algorithm:
Define a state as the number of missionaries and cannibals on each side of the river.
Use BFS or DFS to explore all possible transitions (moving a certain number of missionaries or cannibals).
Ensure that cannibals never outnumber missionaries on either side.
The goal is to get all missionaries and cannibals to the opposite side.

6. Vacuum Cleaner Problem:
Algorithm:
Represent the environment as a grid of rooms (clean or dirty).
Use a simple reflex agent or a search-based approach to explore the rooms.
If the room is dirty, clean it.
Move to the next room according to some strategy (e.g., BFS, DFS).
The problem is solved when all rooms are clean.

7. BFS (Breadth-First Search) Algorithm:
Algorithm:
Start from the root node or initial state.
Enqueue the initial node in a queue.
While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and explore its neighbors.
Mark the node as visited.
If the goal is found, stop the search.
Otherwise, continue enqueuing unvisited neighbors.

8. DFS (Depth-First Search) Algorithm:
Algorithm:
Start from the root node or initial state.
Push the initial node into a stack.
While the stack is not empty, pop a node and explore its neighbors.
Mark the node as visited.
If the goal is found, stop the search.
Otherwise, continue pushing unvisited neighbors into the stack.

9. Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP):
Algorithm:
Represent the cities as nodes and the distances between them as edges.
Use dynamic programming, greedy approaches, or approximation algorithms to find the shortest possible tour that visits all cities.
For dynamic programming, use a bitmask to keep track of visited cities and memoize the minimum distance.
Return to the starting city once all other cities are visited.

10. A Algorithm:*
Algorithm:
Start from the initial node and use a priority queue to keep track of nodes.
For each node, calculate the cost to reach the goal using a heuristic (e.g., Manhattan distance).
Dequeue the node with the lowest cost.
If it is the goal node, stop the search.
Otherwise, update the costs for its neighbors and continue.
